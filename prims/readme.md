# Prim's Algorithm
Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. 


## Pseudocode:
```
Select an arbitrary vertex s to start the tree from.

While (there are still nontree vertices)
  
    Select the edge of minimum weight between a tree and nontree vertex
  
    Add the selected edge and vertex to the MST tree T.

```
