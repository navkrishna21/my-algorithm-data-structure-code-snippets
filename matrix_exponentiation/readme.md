# Matrix Exponentiation
Matrix Exponentiation (also known as matrix power, repeated squaring) is a technique used to solve linear recurrences. This technique is very useful in competitive programming when dealing with linear recurrences (appears along Dynamic Programming). This technique also solves a lot of problems in graph theory.
